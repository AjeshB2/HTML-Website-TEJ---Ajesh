          <h1><center>Environmental Impact</center></h1>
          <h2>Computer Device Production</h2>
          <p><b>Carbon Footprint:</b> The massive computer production plants require lots of energy due to the machinery used to create the computer parts. This results in a large amount of carbon emissions coming from them. Computer manufacturing plants also produce other harmful substances such as heavy metals, volatile organic compounds and more. All of these substances negatively impact the surrounding environment as well as humans that live near the plants. The constant updating of parts as technology advances increases the amount of e-waste produced from these plants. </p>
          <p><b>Natural Resource Extraction:</b> The production of computers requires the extraction of many natural resources such as gold, silver, copper, and more. This could lead to the alteration or destruction of natural land forms causing issues with the land such as soil erosion, water pollution, etc. Large areas are excavated in order to collect these materials which destroys several habitats and exterminates the ecosystem in the area. Processing of raw materials requires harmful fuels such as fossil fuels and increases carbon emissions. </p>
          <h2>Computer Device Use</h2>
          <p><b>Cloud and Data Storage:</b> Cloud and data storage also requires large amounts of energy. Even more than personal computers. Since they use massive servers to store computer information, these servers require lots of energy which are often supplied by fossil fuel plants and other harmful energy generation methods.</p>
          <p><b>Replacement of Devices:</b> People constantly upgrade and buy the latest product, as technology advances. This makes people dispose of old computer devices, almost every year as new products come out. This is the main contributor of e-waste. Many of this e-waste is not disposed of properly which causes them to be left in land fills and garbage dumps. Many of these computer devices may also be perfectly usable however, they prematurely get thrown away to be replaced with the latest product.</p>
          <p><b>Energy Use:</b> When we use computers we also consume large amounts of energy. This energy often comes from harmful sources that release greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful substances into the environment. Long term use of computers and leaving them on standby, increases the amount of electricity being used by the average person.</p>
          <h2>Computer Device Disposal</h2>
          <p><b>E-Waste:</b> E-waste or electronic waste is any waste made up from electronic parts or comes from electronic parts. E-waste usually comes from outdated or products that have reached the end of their life cycle. E-waste often ends up in landfills which harms the natural environment including humans. This is because many electronics produce harmful chemicals when left out with the elements for a long period of time. Many parts in these electronics also take years to decompose and through the decomposition process, release harmful substances into the environment.</p>
