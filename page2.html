          <h2>Hardware Connections</h2>
          <p>The Microbit is first connected to the servo motor via the alligator clips. These are connected so that the wires are clipped onto the Microbit's 0, 3V and GND pins. These are then connected to the motor using the male side of the wires. To power the device, the Microbit is plugged into a small power bank or any suitable power supply using its USB cable.</p>

          <center><p id="bottomtext"><b>E-Waste:</b> E-waste or electronic waste is any waste made up from electronic parts or comes from electronic parts. E-waste usually comes from outdated or products that have reached the end of their life cycle. E-waste often ends up in landfills which harms the natural environment including humans. This is because many electronics produce harmful chemicals when left out with the elements for a long period of time. Many parts in these electronics also take years to decompose and through the decomposition process, release harmful substances into the environment.</p></center>
