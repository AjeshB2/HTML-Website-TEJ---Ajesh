          <h3>Computer Device Production</h3>
          <p><b>Carbon Footprint:</b> The massive computer production plants require lots of energy due to the machinery used to create the computer parts. This results in a large amount of carbon emissions coming from them. Computer manufacturing plants also produce other harmful substances such as heavy metals, volatile organic compounds and more. All of these substances negatively impact the surrounding environment as well as humans that live near the plants. The constant updating of parts as technology advances increases the amount of e-waste produced from these plants. </p>
          <p><b>Natural Resource Extraction:</b> The production of computers requires the extraction of many natural resources such as gold, silver, copper, and more. This could lead to the alteration or destruction of natural land forms causing issues with the land such as soil erosion, water pollution, etc. Large areas are excavated in order to collect these materials which destroys several habitats and exterminates the ecosystem in the area. Processing of raw materials requires harmful fuels such as fossil fuels and increases carbon emissions. </p>
