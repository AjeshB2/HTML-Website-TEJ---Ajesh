          <center><h2>Target</h2></center>
          <center><p>PassLock targets any person who values the safety of their home. This also allows loved ones to have access to their home while preventing unwanted people from coming in. </p></center>
          <center><h2>Core Features</h2></center>
          <center><p>The PassLock features a central microbit that acts as the input for the password. This will be done by using the A and B buttons on the microbit which will be put in a certain combination to unlock the door. The door will open using a servo motor which adjusts the angle of the door to open. If the password is deemed incorrect, the door will stay shut and the microbit plays an alarm noise. </p></center>
