          <center><p>The PassLock is a device created using the Microbit and a servo motor to create a password lock system. A door connected to the PassLock will be protected from break-ins since the door will only open when the correct password is inputted. More information can be found in the navigation bar above, as well as our other product, Breezy.</p></center>

          <center><h2>Problem Adressed</h2></center>
          <center><p>My device will solve the problem of home security. This helps people make sure only the residents of a home are going into it. The password lock prevents criminals from potentially breaking into a house.</p></center>
          <center><h2>Target</h2></center>
          <center><p>Any person who values the safety of their home. This also allows loved ones to have access to their home while preventing unwanted people from coming in. </p></center>
          <center><h2>Core Features</h2></center>
          <center><p>The prototype will feature a central microbit that acts as the input for the password. This will be done by using the A and B buttons on the microbit which will be put in a certain combination to unlock the door. The door will open using a servo motor which adjusts the angle of the door to open. If the password is deemed incorrect, the door will stay shut and the microbit plays an alarm noise. </p></center>
